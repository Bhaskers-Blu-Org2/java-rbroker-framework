    <h3>Java RBroker Framework ~ Simple R Integration for Java Application Developers</h3>

<p>
    The Java RBroker Framework exposes a high-level programming model for building DeployR-enabled client applications. By using the RBroker Framework an application developer can focus entirely on integrating R Analytics, while offloading the complexity of managing client-side API task queues and server-side R session lifecycles.

<p>
The basic programming model for working with the framework is as follows:

<p>
<ol>
    <li>Decide if the R Analytics tasks for your application should execute as:
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>
        <i>Discrete tasks:</i> authentication optional, grid resources allocated
at runtime, results returned immediately, no persistence. Good for 
prototyping and public facing production deployments.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
        <i>Pooled tasks:</i> authentication required, grid resources pre-allocated,
results returned immediately, optional persistence to repository. Good for enterprise
production deployments, consistent runtime, high-throughput environments.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
        <i>Background tasks:</i> authentication required, grid resources allocated at runtime,
results persisted for later retrieval. Good for periodic, scheduled or batch processing.
        </li><br/>
    </ol>
    <li>
Use the RBrokerFactory to create an appropriate instance of RBroker.
    </li>
    <p>
    <li>
Use the RTaskFactory to create one or more RTask for your application.
    </li>
    <p>
    <li>
Submit your RTask to RBroker for execution.
    </li>
    <p>
    <li>
Track the progress of your RTask using RTaskToken.
    </li>
    <p>
    <li>
Integrate the results of your RTask found within RTaskResult.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
This programming model can be further simplified for application developers by leveraging asynchronous callbacks. Simply register an {@link com.revo.deployr.client.broker.RTaskListener} with your {@link com.revo.deployr.client.broker.RBroker} instance and the RBroker will automatically notify your application when each {@link com.revo.deployr.client.broker.RTask} completes. This approach allows your application to skip step 5. above and scale effortlessly.
